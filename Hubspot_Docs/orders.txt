Commerce Payments API
---------------------

### Overview
Retrieve information about payments (last modified September 26, 2025). If payment processing is set up through HubSpot payments or Stripe payment processing, this API can create payments, update them, retrieve payment data, delete payments, create payment records for external transactions, associate payments with invoices, and retrieve refunded payments.

### Limitations
- The account must be set up to collect payments through HubSpot payments or Stripe payment processing.
- Payments created through Commerce Hub payment processing (HubSpot payments or Stripe payment processing) cannot be modified or deleted via this API.
- This API cannot create payments intended for payment processing; it tracks payment data that represents revenue received outside of Commerce Hub.

### Create payments
- Make a `POST` request to `/crm/v3/objects/commerce_payments`.
- Minimum body contents: a `properties` object containing `hs_initial_amount` and `hs_initiated_date`. Add other properties as needed (read-only properties cannot be set).
- Include an `associations` array to associate the payment with CRM records (e.g., contacts, orders).
- Example request body:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "hs_initial_amount": "99.99",
    "hs_initiated_date": "2024-03-27T18:04:11.823Z",
    "hs_customer_email": "customer@example.com"
  },
  "associations": [
    {
      "to": {
        "id": 70791348501
      },
      "types": [
        {
          "associationCategory": "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
          "associationTypeId": 387
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "to": {
        "id": 44446244097
      },
      "types": [
        {
          "associationCategory": "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
          "associationTypeId": 542
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- Field descriptions:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `properties` | Object | Key-value pairs for each property to set. |
| `associations` | Array | Contains association details. |
| `to` | Object | Contains the ID of the CRM record to associate the payment with. |
| `types` | Array | Contains association type details. |
| `associationCategory` | String | HUBSPOT_DEFINED or USER_DEFINED. |
| `associationTypeId` | Number | Unique identifier for the association type between the payment and the other object. |
